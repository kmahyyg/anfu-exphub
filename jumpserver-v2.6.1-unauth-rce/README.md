# JumpServer v2.6.1 Unauthenticated RCE Exploit

## Dependencies

- websockets
- requests

Can be installed using: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Limitation

- Previous Connection on the server side might be reused (which was I couldn't control)
- Program might need to wait for a few seconds (same as the TCP Socket, you always don't know what's next)
- Interactive TTY is not implemented because possible WS wrapper is relatively high workload.

## Usage

- Switch to your favorite virtual Python environment
- Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Open `exp.py`, after the `DON'T CHANGE` block, you might need to change the `User MODIFICATION PART` like the path of jumpserver installation dir or miscellaneous part counter threshold or something else you want.
- Run `python3 ./exp.py http(s)://IP:PORT`
- The program will interactively guide you thorough the whole process.

**Note: Since the assets and system users might be modified and log files is rotating, you might need to change COUNT_THRESHOLD and select a proper asset to hack.**
